      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently living in Edinburgh, looking to transition into Software
        Development. I have always had a interest into solving complex problems
        efficiently and learning new effective ways to optimise a solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have recently completed The Jump Digital School's 30 week Full-Stack
        Software Engineer bootmap. During the bootcamp I learnt how to develop
        and deploy full-stack websites and applications to industry standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently looking for a full Time Software Development role. If you
        have any questions or want to say hi, pop me an email at
        <a href="mailto:moyo@hotmail.com" className="impact"> moyo.amoo@hotmail.com</a>
      </p>
